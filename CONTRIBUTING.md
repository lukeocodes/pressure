## Development Guidelines

### Project Structure

- `docs/` - Documentation
- `netlify/functions/` - Serverless backend
- `src/lib/` - Shared utilities and services
- `src/pages/` - Frontend pages
- `src/campaigns/` - Campaign configurations

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable names

### Testing

Before submitting:

1. Test locally with `npm run dev`
2. Test the build with `npm run build && npm run preview`
3. Test with different email providers
4. Verify mobile responsiveness
5. Check accessibility

### Documentation

Update documentation when:

- Adding new features
- Changing configuration options
- Adding email providers
- Modifying API endpoints

Documentation files in `docs/` should use sentence case for filenames.

## Adding Email Providers

To add a new email provider:

1. Create a new adapter in `src/lib/email/providers/your-provider.ts`
2. Implement the `EmailService` interface
3. Add factory logic in `src/lib/email/factory.ts`
4. Update `docs/Email Service Abstraction.md`
5. Add environment variables to `.env.example`
6. Update README with provider documentation

Example:

```typescript
import { BaseEmailService } from "../service";
import type { EmailOptions, EmailResult } from "../../types";

export class YourProviderEmailService extends BaseEmailService {
  async sendEmail(options: EmailOptions): Promise<EmailResult> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```
